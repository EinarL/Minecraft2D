make puch hand go in the direction of the mouse

better sound for breaking blocks.
maybe different sound for walking on grass.

make it so that you can place a block in the BackBackground behind an entity and player

picking up items make them fly at you with some velocity and then put in your inventory

there is a bug in the spawning trees when you load a chunk that hasnt finished spawning the entire tree, then you close the game
and open it again, the game wont know that it was spawning a tree so it wont continue to spawn in the tree
FIX: have a variable in chunkData that corresponds how much is left off spawning a tree, also the treeHeight

change how ores spawn

furnaces sometimes cant be accessed due to FrontBacgroundBlocks being on the same block

change it so that all blocks are tiles initially in a chunk and when the chunk next to the spawns, i.e. the chunk has chunks on both sides of it,
then change the tiles that are exposed to air to gameObjects
FIXING THIS WOULD ONLY BOOST PERFORMANCE

finish implementing charcoal

dont have the sky/background as blue below bedrock, rather black

change it so that you can place frontBackgroundBlocks where players and entities are

change the sound for breaking wood blocks

make it so that BackBackground blocks dont break noFloatType blocks that are above it 

make it so that torches are NoFloatType, but you need another implementation because they can "float" if there is a block behind them

make it so that when youre spawning a new chunk then more animals will spawn rather than when spawning a previously spawned in chunk

burp sound for steve

make particle systems for: eating, when entities dissapear when they die, when steve runs, breaking blocks

add fall damage for entities
